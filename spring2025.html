    <p>This course recognizes a select number of undergraduate students who are interested in global affairs, want to
        explore the nature of honorable business within our globalized world, and who seek to explore the ethical and
        professional challenges and opportunities for pursuing business as a force for good in the international
        context(s). International Business Fellows will be encouraged to participate in the activities of the Business
        Ethics and Society program beyond the Colloquium. In addition, International Business Fellows are expected to
        enroll each semester in the 1.5 credit International Business Fellows Colloquium, which meets once weekly and
        provides an opportunity for small-group discussion, close interaction with distinguished faculty and/or business
        leaders, as well as dinner. As a conclusion to the last two offerings of this course, the participants of the
        Colloquium were given the opportunity to participate in an international immersion experience to Poland. The
        trip made possible for students to interact with business leaders and politicians, and explore the challenges
        and opportunities of business in one of Europe’s fastest growing economies, as well as exploring business in a
        post-communist free market economy within the context of Catholic Social Thought and the influence of Pope St.
        John Paul II. While there is no guarantee that participants of this colloquium would be able to once again
        travel for such an experience, we are actively exploring this possibility and hope to offer it as an option as
        details emerge. The immersion experience will be contingent upon funding.

    <p>Eastern Christians and their Churches are an indispensable part of global Christianity that sheds light on its
        origins, its basic theological tenets, its achievements, and its historical failures, dilemmas, and challenges.
        The course provides an overview of the variety of Eastern-rite Christian Churches belonging to the different
        cultural traditions of Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The students will be introduced to the
        theological views and liturgical life of Eastern-rite Christians, i.e., Orthodox, Oriental, and Eastern
        Catholic, and their fascinating history. We shall explore the Byzantine rite Churches in more detail, and
        discuss the challenges their theology and history present to contemporary world and international relations.
        Special attention will be given to Slavic Christianity and particularly to Russian and Ukrainian religious
        history. Reflections on the diversity of Eastern Christian traditions lead to insights into theological, moral,
        and cultural issues of particular importance for today such as ecumenism, war and non-violence, Christian
        Churches and totalitarianism, the role of liturgy and ritual in modern culture. </p>

        deadline: Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2024.</p>

    <p>Diplomacy is a way of doing politics: the established method of negotiating inter-state relations and of
        influencing the decisions and behavior of foreign governments and peoples through presence and engagement,
        dialogue, and negotiation. Violence and wars, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, show both the limits
        and strict necessity of diplomacy as a key tool for ensuring peaceful human coexistence. Diplomats are committed
        to their home country, but also their host country and the bigger picture of the common good. Contributors to
        peace building and peacekeeping, diplomats serve political purposes through cultural engagement. In this way,
        they contribute to "integral human development" in the design of international relations. The Nanovic Institute
        invites undergraduate students to join our Diplomacy Scholars Program through Deep Dive into Diplomacy. This
        course examines diplomacy as a tool in European relations and affairs while providing students the opportunity
        to hone diplomatic skills such as conflict mediation, judgment and decision making, intercultural competencies,
        and written and oral communication. Students will learn from present and former diplomats about the diplomatic
        way of life and participate in a number of simulations and activities beyond the classroom.</p>

    <p>What are cities, and how do they work? How do present (and how will future) societies respond to the challenges
        of pollution, sustainable development, exploitation of natural resources, equal access to infrastructure,
        education and welfare, human rights, food production and distribution, and energy consumption?</p>

    <p>This course welcomes students to reflect on these questions and respond to these challenges through the emerging
        field of urban ethics. Through lectures and readings, we will ask: 1. Can we define an “ancient urban ethics?"
        2. Which disciplines are involved in urban ethics, and what strategies—from environmental to social
        ethics—should inform it? 3. What policies, planning documents, and environmental and information technologies
        from the past and present can we avail from around the world to understand urban ethics? To ground our
        discussions, we will read excerpts from classical literature, philosophy, and cross-disciplinary works. We will
        also engage resources including maps, drawings, art, photographs, and videos. As we will discover through
        discussion and participation, urban ethics is a field in which everyone is involved.</p>

    <p>In 1419, a Florentine goldsmith designed a building that changed the history of Western architecture. It was the
        first structure since antiquity to systematically apply the formal vocabulary of ancient Greco-Roman
        architecture. This new experiment with old ideas took Florence and then Europe by storm. In this course, we will
        investigate the revival—and transformation—of the classical architectural language, the emerging ideas about
        architectural authorship, the ability of architectural forms and materials to convey particular meanings to
        particular audiences, and the deployment of architecture as an instrument of power.</p>

    <p>This course will examine the translation of the sacred on the Island of Ireland. It will offer an introduction to
        translation theory, examining many of the key issues linked to the translation of the sacred texts in a global
        context before turning its attention to the Irish context. Central to the course will be the translation of the
        bible into the Irish language, known as Bedel’s bible, undertaken at the behest of Queen Elizabeth the 1. It
        will examine how translation lay at the heart of the colonial project. Other topics examined will be the issue
        of Vatican 2 and the question of the vernacular, the Irish language masses composed by people like Seán Ó Riada
        or Tomás Ó Canainn, and the recent projects which offer a version of the gospels in Ulster Scots.

    <p>This course will examine the tradition of the long poem in Irish literature, both in the Irish and English
        languages. It will examine poems such as the epic, An Táin and “Cúirt an Mheánoíche” (The Midnight Court) in a
        variety of translations, or the poem the “Great Hunger” by Patrick Kavanagh. It will investigate the
        intersection between the epic and the long poem, and discuss the poetic sequence. It will also examine more
        contemporary long poems such as those by Martina Evans and Thomas McCarthy, alongside hyper-contemporary work by
        Dawn Watson.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Why do we tell stories? Myths and legends can help us understand what the people who created them have valued at
        different places and times. These texts have been interpreted as vessels of national identity, points of access
        to divine truth, indices of level of civilizational development, and pedagogical tools. They have also inspired
        some of the most compelling works of art ever produced. Students in this course will learn more about some of
        the many cultures of Eurasia, the world’s largest continent, spanning West Asia (the Middle East), Central Asia,
        and Eastern Europe, from these cultures' perspectives. They will read about what role Raven played in the
        creation of the world, learn the secret of the legendary Simorgh, and watch the tragic love story between a
        forest spirit and a human. They will consider the links between ancient folklore and contemporary fantasy. They
        will also have the opportunity to think about the role these stories play in the cultures that produced them and
        in their own lives. This class is co-taught by two scholars with different backgrounds: a historian of West Asia
        and the United States and a specialist in the literature of Russia and the former Soviet Union. In this class,
        students will learn how scholars in different disciplines (including not just literature and history but also
        folklore and anthropology) might approach the same works very differently and learn how to articulate their own
        scholarly positions. Assignments include a folklore collection, an in-class presentation on one of the cultures
        studied, and a creative adaptation of a myth. Students will also be graded on class participation and given
        weekly online reading quizzes.</p>

        legacy of defeat, challenge and authority in the Weimar Republic, the National Socialist revolution, war and
        Holocaust, collapse of the Third Reich, conflict and accommodation in East and West Germany, and unification and

    </ul>
    <p>England's seventeenth century provides one of the most compelling epochs of human history, full of a cast of
        remarkable characters. Once Elizabeth I died in 1603, a new dynasty, the Scottish royal house, the Stuarts, came
        to the throne in the person of James VI & I. A new political dynamic ensued. Insoluble tensions arose between
        perceived licentiousness in high politics on one hand and puritan moral rigour on the other, between royal
        control of religion and a hankering after policies based on literal Biblical interpretation and also between a
        gaping royal treasury and public reluctance to contribute financially to the realm. These, and other factors,
        resulted in the unthinkable: the dissolution of the ties that had held English politics and society together.
        The Civil War (or "Great Rebellion", or "Puritan Revolution" depending on the interpretation favored) that
        resulted gave rise to a welter of new constitutional ideas, religious experiments and virulent anti-Catholicism.
        These were all set loose as King and Parliament fought for domination of the country. We will pay particular
        attention to the figure of Oliver Cromwell, who came to command English politics both before and after the
        hitherto unimaginable public execution of the king (who many believed was God's anointed). We will also ask why
        the English after allowing their king to be executed and their toleration a substantial Interregnum subsequently
        restored Charles II, their erstwhile king's son, as monarch. Remarkable figures that we will encounter and
        evaluate include the Leveller John Lilburne, the poet John Milton, Praise-God Barebones (yes, that is a name)
        and the libidinous Samuel Pepys.</p>

    <p>Imagine a world stripped of magic, where cold rationality reigns supreme and the supernatural has been banished
        to the realm of fiction. Now consider our own world, where Silicon Valley technocrats consult AI oracles, where
        political ideologies inspire quasi-religious fervor, and where the “spiritual but not religious” seek
        transcendence in everything from meditation apps to psychedelic retreats. Which of these worlds more accurately
        describes our modern condition?</p>

    <p>This course challenges the notion that modernity and secularization have disenchanted our world, proposing
        instead that enchantment persists and even thrives in unexpected corners of contemporary life. From Weber's
        Protestant ethic to UFO believers in the American Southwest, commodity fetishism in South America to Islamic
        modernities in Lebanon, we will ask fundamental questions: How do myths and rituals shape our understanding of
        the world, even in ostensibly secular societies? What role does enchantment play in science, technology, and
        politics? How do different cultures negotiate the boundaries between the sacred and the profane, the rational
        and the magical? Drawing upon ethnographic studies and theoretical texts, we will explore how the categories of
        “religious” and “secular” are constructed, contested, and reimagined in various cultural contexts.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>A cliché, a painful truth, an old story, a new one—this course explores alcohol and alcoholism in Irish
        literature, Irish society and Irishness, examining how alcohol infuses the stories Irish people tell and those
        told about them, and asking what happens if we take alcohol(ism) seriously as a framework and topic of analysis.
        We will think about the romance and conviviality of drink and drinking, pubs and wakes and more; and
        counterposed crusades against drinking (by Father Mathew and others), as well as the unromantic and destructive
        dimension so central to recent writing. We will think about alcohol(ism) in relation to political authority and
        nationalism, as well as in relation to colonial resistance, recalcitrance and recovery. We will ask how this
        "inheritance" travels into Irish America, and even to this campus, asking what legacies are being lived out, and
        why, and what we make of that. The course will feature a diverse set of texts across a span of Irish literary
        tradition, including medieval and contemporary, fiction and memoir, poetry and prose, verbal, visual and musical
        media. On the way students will work on their speaking, analytical and writing skills. Course work will include
        short writing assignments and analytical papers, a presentation, and a creative assignment.</p>

    <p>This course will consider questions of gender, culture, and identity in looking at the history of women in
        Ireland. How has Ireland historically been figured female? We will consider the gendering of Ireland as a nation
        through the allegories of Éire and Hibernia, but also through the writing and representation of figures both
        real and mythic—from Cathleen Ní Houlihan to Maud Gonne and from Saint Brigid to the women of the Magdalene
        laundries. Along the way, we will examine related concerns including questions of masculinity, motherhood,
        class, race, and religion.</p>

    <p>This course will cover a range of humanities disciplines and mediums, considering gender and representation in
        art, literature, music, film, and poetry. The course will utilize collections at Notre Dame's Raclin Murphy

    <p>Over the last two decades of Putin's presidency, Russia's geopolitical strength and imperial ambition were placed
        at the center of Russia's political line. Military incursions in the neighboring countries have expanded
        Russia's territorial claims and reasserted its aspirations to former Soviet spheres of influence. While Russian
        identity continued to be imperial after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Ukrainians set off on a journey
        of building their national identity. The course considers how post-Soviet cinema revives tropes and aesthetic
        tendencies of the earlier periods, such as stark depictions of the self and Other, spiritual superiority and
        monumentalism, as well as updates them for a contemporary context. The class explores the Putin-era Russian
        cinema and Ukrainian national cinema of the last two decades in the light of the common past that these two
        countries share and how the past is reshaped for the present. No previous knowledge of Russian is required, the

        in mind or body and materially devastated much of the heartland of civilization." The above quote from historian
        John Keegan summarizes the significance of studying the Second World War. In this class, students will receive
        an introduction to the largest conflict in human history, from the origins of the war in Asia and Europe to the
        postwar settlements that continue to shape the modern world. Class content will focus on the military,
        diplomatic, and political narratives of the war, while exploring the lived experience of the war through primary

        Mexico City. The course will examine a wide variety of figures, movements, and practices within the visual arts,
        situating them within the social, political, and historical contexts in which they arose. The history of these
        artistic developments (e.g., abstraction, the readymade, conceptual art, feminist art) will be traced through
        the rise of mass-media technologies (such as photography and print media) alongside the aesthetic
        accomplishments of the avant-garde. Exploring the forces of feminism, capitalism, and urbanism, we will attempt
        to understand how artistic innovations fundamentally altered, negotiated, and framed the ways in which we
        understand and represent the world. Artists we will look at include Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Georgia
        O’Keeffe, Dorothea Lange, Frida Kahlo, Jacob Lawrence, Jackson Pollock, Eva Hesse, and Andy Warhol. The
        curriculum will also include visits to the university museum. This course is largely taught in a lecture format
        and assessment is exam-based.</p>

    <p>From the Plantation of Ulster in the early seventeenth century to today the hegemony, and later the survival, of
        native Irish culture in the Irish language has been challenged by English language culture. This course seeks,
        by analyzing primary sources in Irish (available to students in translation) in their historical context, to
        chart this process over time. The course also seeks to ask questions about the extent to which the Irish
        Catholic population resisted or collaborated in the process of anglicization that took place. Was the 'Sacsa nua
        darbh ainm Éire' /(New England going by the name of Ireland) culturally alien to the Irish population that
        resided in it.</p>

    <p>The French Revolution created a turning point in history by paving the way for modern politics and society.
        Napoleon's empire, on the other hand, toppled some of the oldest European monarchies and shook up the
        international status quo. During two and a half turbulent decades, the French destroyed feudalism, created a
        constitutional monarchy, founded a republic, and built an empire that stretched across the continent. Our course
        will focus on how the French reinvented the social, cultural, and political dimensions of their world from the
        1780s to 1815. We will ask major questions such as: What were the origins of the French Revolution? How did the
        revolutionaries recreate political culture and social structures? Why did the Revolution radicalize at first but
        eventually slide into an empire? Was Napoleon the "son of the Revolution" or did he betray its major goals? Of
        special note, our course includes a 4-week "Reacting to the Past" game that allows you to engage in history from
        a completely new perspective. During this historical role-playing unit, you will become a specific member of the
        National Assembly or the Parisian crowd. To win, you must pass a constitution favorable to your position while
        wrestling "with the threat of foreign invasion, political and religious struggles, and questions of liberty and
        citizenship." Although we may change the course of history within the unit, you will root your arguments in
        resources available to your historical persona: primary documents, political treatises, inspiring speeches,
        secret collaborations, and "current" events.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Between the early rumblings of the Reformations and the last cannon shot of World War I, Europeans profoundly
        changed how they conceptualized bodies as experience and metaphors. During these four centuries, Europeans
        grounded the ways in which they interacted with each other and the world in bodily imaginings. On an individual
        level, the living, human body provided a means of accessing and understanding the material or spiritual world.
        On a collective scale, the physical body, its adornments, and its gestures provided markers that Europeans used
        to fracture society along axes of gender, sexuality, class, race, mental aptitude, and even sacrality. Drawing
        in part from their myriad imaginings of the human body, Europeans constructed metaphorical political bodies. The
        body politic assumed diverse forms spanning from divine right monarchs to revolutionary republics to modern
        nation states. Our course will lay bare the human body as culturally constructed, while fleshing out how
        Europeans' evolving visions affected political imaginings.</p>

    <p>Catholic Great Power. Medieval Holdover. Sick Man on the Danube. Prison of the Peoples. Laboratory of the
        Apocalypse. The Habsburg Empire has been called many things, but I bet you never have heard of it. But I bet you
        have heard about the Austrian Archduke, Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination sparked the outbreak of the First
        World War; or maybe your parents made you listen to Mozart as a child in the hopes that you'd be brilliant. What
        you probably don't know, because historians have generally forgotten it, is that the Habsburg Monarchy stood at
        the center of Europe and European politics and culture for nearly four hundred years. Germans, Croatians,
        Slovenes, Poles, Jews, Czechs, Slovaks, Serbs, Bosnians, Romanians, Italians, Ukrainians and (last but not
        least) Hungarians all played a role in the longevity and vibrancy of this multinational Empire. In this course,
        we will explore the history of this great continental empire from its modern origins during the reign of Maria
        Theresia (1740-1780) to its collapse and dismemberment in the First World War. In the process we will learn much
        about the history of Europe itself and about what becomes common knowledge and what does not. Our topics will
        include Enlightened Absolutism, the French Revolution, Liberalism, German Unification, Music and Culture,
        modernity, economic development, Jewish emancipation and identity, and finally the First World War.</p>

    <p>Russia under the tsars was a vast empire, a land of stunning achievement and immense inequality, mired in
        backwardness yet also a laboratory of modernity. Through works of scholarship, art, and cinema, and writings by
        Russians from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, we will explore how women and men, peasants and aristocrats,
        conservatives and revolutionaries, experienced the power and contradictions of the Romanov empire. This is a
        seminar. There will be occasional lectures, but mostly we will have oral discussions about the readings, Russian
        historical films, and works of art that depict the everyday life of diverse groups in imperial Russian society.
        There are many ways of knowing the world - scientific, artistic, and other ways. Ours will be historical. This
        means that we will examine how the totality of life changed over time. We will consider the past from many
        angles, for instance, politics, culture, and the social order. We will discuss interpretations proposed by
        historians, analyze the primary sources on which they are based, and construct our own interpretations. We will
        not render facile judgments on the people of the past, but we will also explore what their legacy means for us
        today. We will examine imperial Russian history from three distinct perspectives: - What do we know about the
        actual course of imperial Russian history? - What are the original sources on which our knowledge is based? -
        What role do artistic representations of this era play in modern Russian culture?</p>

    <p>This class introduces students to the history of Catholicism since the French Revolution, focusing primarily on
        Europe. It examines how Catholics confronted the challenges of modernity - from liberal democracy and
        nationalism; to capitalism and modern science; to new political ideologies such as fascism and communism. We
        will explore not only how these encounters transformed the Church, but also how Catholicism itself has shaped
        modern politics and culture. The first part of the course begins with the nineteenth-century - culture wars -
        between Catholics and anticlerical forces, focusing in particular on popular devotions like the Lourdes
        pilgrimage and the perceived "feminization" of religion. The second part of the course shifts to the twentieth
        century and examines the relationship between the Catholic Church and modern political ideologies such as
        nationalism, fascism, communism, and democracy. The third part of the course explores modern Catholic art,
        literature, and film. Finally, we close by examining the more recent history of Catholicism since the
        transformative changes of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. Readings are drawn from a range of primary
        sources - including novels, speeches, Church documents, works of art, and films - as well as secondary sources

    <p>In 1987, the Soviet Union was the largest political entity on the planet. Four years later, it had vanished from
        the map entirely. In this interdisciplinary course, you will learn about the ‘new Russia’ that has emerged in
        the three decades since this stunning collapse. Drawing on an array of resources in English translation, you
        will explore the politics, media, and culture of the post-Soviet period: from the lawless years of the “wild
        90s” under Boris Yeltsin to the return of totalitarianism under Vladimir Putin and his brutal invasion of
        Ukraine. In so doing, your study of contemporary Russia will lead us to discuss some of the most pressing
        questions in global politics today. What is the nature of truth and power in Putin’s dystopian propaganda state?
        Should the current leadership in Russia be described as a fascist regime or neo-Soviet? And, perhaps most
        importantly, how did Russia’s democratic experiment ultimately end with the launch of the largest war in Europe
        since 1945—and what lessons might this failure hold for America and the rest of the world?</p>

    <p>In this course, you will examine how love and gender were debated in French and Occitan literatures from before
        1500. Debates appear everywhere and they often convey the idea that arguing is intellectually, socially, and
        emotionally beneficial to those involved. So in this class, we will ask ourselves: How might arguing be good for
        you? Through the lens of debates on love and gender, we will survey some of the most important works of medieval
        French literature and unpack a range of thought-provoking texts. Questions that we will examine include: What
        does a woman know that a man doesn’t? Is it better for a man to be faithful while being cheated on or should he
        be promiscuous? What are the limits of mansplaining? Can a man convince a woman to love him through reasoning?
        Is the best type of man brave or wise, pushy or patient, braggy or humble? What are the terms of an open
        relationship? Where does happiness fit in with love and marriage?

    <p>Dante’s Comedy is one of the masterpieces of Western literature. It is also a comprehensive synthesis of the
        cultural tradition up to its time (from antiquity to the late Middle Ages), a daring experiment in language,
        poetics and poetic technique, and a profound exploration of Christian spirituality.</p>

    <p>Dante I and Dante II (ROIT 40115 and 40116) are a close, discussion-based study over two semesters of the entire
        Comedy, in its cultural (historical, literary, political, philosophical) context. Dante I explores the works
        that precede the Comedy, and the Inferno. Dante II focuses on the Purgatorio and Paradiso, along with the
        Monarchia. These are separate courses and can be taken individually, or in either order, although they do form
        an integrated sequence.</p>

    <p>Lectures and discussion in English; the text will be read in a facing-page translation, so we can refer to the

    <p>NB: Taught in Italian. In this course, students will make a close and critical reading of Giovanni Boccaccio’s
        collection of one hundred short stories, the Decameron. A founding work of Italian literature, recognized for
        centuries as its best example of prose writing, its author wanted it to be an ethical manual for critically
        understanding reality and its political, social, and religious tenets, under the appearance of a mere
        entertaining work. From the experience of the 1348 Black Plague to daily issues in protocapitalist Florence,
        from tales of magicians and enchanted gardens to tongue-in-cheek stories, from relationships between husband and
        wives, children and parents, to those between kings, sultans, and their subjects, Boccaccio’s stories allow us
        to better understand our past, while challenging our views on the self, faith, society, and the other.

    <p>This course begins in the 1960s, when Italy stood at the center of the film world, and traces the history of
        Italian cinema to the present day. We will focus on the heyday of Italian auteurs – Federico Fellini,
        Michelangelo Antonioni, Luchino Visconti, and Pier Paolo Pasolini – examining how each brought a singular vision
        to the collective medium of cinema. Working against the hegemony of Hollywood, Italian filmmakers in the
        twentieth century created new forms of representation that inspired audiences worldwide. They continue to do so
        in the new millennium, building on the innovations of illustrious predecessors like Bertolucci and Pontecorvo,
        Wertmüller and Cavani to reveal new realities to moviegoers across the globe. We will analyze how questions of
        class, faith, gender, identity, and ideology intersect on screen as Italian directors seek both to expose and to
        recreate the illusions by which we live. With a filmography featuring both masterpieces of world cinema and cult
        classics, this course will investigate how pioneering Italian directors reshaped every genre of film, including
        action & adventure, comedy, crime, documentary, melodrama, mystery, thriller, horror, and more. The course is
        taught in English and all films will have English subtitles.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>NB: Taught in French. The nineteenth century saw the rise of print media and professional institutions.
        Old-fashioned whisper networks came to be viewed suspiciously as a dangerous, “feminine” pastime for those
        without lives of their own. Yet the enduring popularity of gossip—in society columns, romans-à-clef, communal
        laundry rooms, and political caricatures—meant that informal social networks thrived, fueled by a heightened
        interest in the private lives of famous people. The learning goals of this class extend beyond those of textual
        analysis and the researched argument to media literacy. Following several scandals across a variety of sources,
        we will study how information was transmitted via different genres, spaces, and voices in nineteenth-century
        France, looking at a range of texts from broadsheets to Offenbach operettas. While reinforcing social mores,
        gossip also provided a means of resistance to the status quo, a way for the marginalized to reframe official
        narratives and point to the humanity shared across classes and identities.

    </ul>
    <p>NB: Taught in French. This course involves the close study of novels, films, and essays that examine the evolving
        realities of refugees and migrants in the French-speaking world today. It explores what it means for so many
        individuals to leave their homeland behind and seek asylum in France, and it focuses on the stories of these
        global movements and their implications for identities, whether the protagonists wind up in Paris — or in
        another location, such as South Bend, Indiana. This is the first course of its kind to incorporate engagement
        with Francophone families who live near Notre Dame and who lack knowledge of the English language and American
        customs. Once every two weeks, students will meet with local refugees who speak French and need assistance with
        learning English as well as with a number of other aspects of life in the United States. Tutoring and providing
        information, as well as assisting in practical tasks like filling out forms will make up some of the activities
        that students participate in with refugees, but another crucial component of these interactions will entail
        becoming familiar with their stories and putting them to paper in creative form, in French. Listening to and
        valorizing the personal narratives of people from Francophone Africa will be an important aspect of the time
        spent with them, and hearing these oral accounts may give new resonance to the French-language books and films
        on our syllabus that constitute creative contemporary renditions of migration.

    <p>How are identities important in a world of frictions and connections? How do different societies deal with

        democracies change as a result? What are the differences between multiculturalism, relativism, and pluralism?
        The course addresses such questions by focusing on issues including but not limited to police violence and urban
        riots; Arab Uprisings; Muslim-Christian-Jewish relationships (conflict and coexistence) in Egypt and Iran;
        gendered practices and embodied aesthetics; the experience of refugees, and the crafting of identities, in the

    <p>NB: Students must complete an application and be admitted into the Diplomacy Fellows program. Application
        deadline: Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2024. Diplomacy is a way of doing politics: the established method of negotiating
        inter-state relations and of
        influencing the decisions and behavior of foreign governments and peoples through presence and engagement,
        dialogue, and negotiation. Diplomats are committed to their home country, but also their host country and the
        bigger picture of the common good. Contributors to peace building and peacekeeping, diplomats, serve political
        purposes through cultural engagement. In this way, they contribute to "integral human development" in the design
        of international relations. The Nanovic Institute invites undergraduate students to join our Diplomacy Scholars
        Program through Deep Dive Into Diplomacy. This course will examine diplomacy as a tool in European relations and
        affairs while providing students the opportunity to hone diplomatic skills such as conflict mediation, judgement
        and decision making, intercultural competencies, and written and oral communication. Students will learn from
        present and former diplomats about the diplomatic way of life and participate in a number of simulations and
        activities beyond the classroom.</p>
