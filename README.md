# Code-Snippets
This repository is what you would call a true "repository." I'll be adding different code snippets I expect to need to reuse here for other projects.

You should expect to see a good mix of different languages, currently including:
1. Dax
2. PowerFX
3. Azure Workflow Definition Language (Power Autoamte)

Thanks and let me know if you have suggestions or want to use this code in your projects.
